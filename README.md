This project analyzes credit card transactions to uncover spending patterns, card usage behavior, and expenditure trends. Using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.), it provides insights such as:

🔍 Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preparation – Handles missing values, formats dates, and ensures data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifies spending distribution, peak transaction periods, and card usage patterns.

Expenditure Insights – Calculates daily, monthly, and overall average expenditure.

Category & Card Type Analysis – Determines the most common expense categories and frequently used card types.

Visualization – Graphs and charts for better understanding of spending trends.

📊 Example Insights

Which expense categories have the highest spending?

Which card types are used most frequently?
